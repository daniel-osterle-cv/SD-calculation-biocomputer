# SD-calculation-biocomputer
This code was used for a project that aimed at using a biocomputer to calculate the standard deviation of three numbers ranging from 0-9. 
A biocomputer is a system that uses biological components, such as DNA, RNA, proteins, or living cells, to perform computational tasks.
Briefly, in this specific project a system was designed that uses small molecules as input, and fluorescent proteins as output. The system was designed such that the concentration of input represents a number and these two numbers were
either added or subtracted. With these simple operations a calculator for standard deviation could be designed based on the following formula:
This formular represents an approximation or alternative way to calculate the standard deviation. Therefore, the correlation between this alternative and exact method was first checked in a bootstrap simulation.
A correlation higher than 0.8 was deemed acceptable for the purposes of this project and as can be seen in the resulting figures, a maximum of three numbers satisfy this condition.
